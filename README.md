# Fansite Bot

A discord bot mainly made for tracking kpop fansites on twitter.   
You can add accounts to follow per channel.    
Whenever those accounts post something, their tweets will be sent to the specified channel.


Invite link is public, but abusing the bot **will** get you blacklisted.    
(eg. spamming `$reset` or adding too many follows)
